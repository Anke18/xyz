# SASS

We use syntactically awesome style sheets \([SASS](https://sass-lang.com)\) for the client application. Compiled css are included in the repository. With SASS installed it is possible to compile style sheets with following command `sass -update public/css` from the application root.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We are planning to include the style sheets in the WebPack bundling process in a future release.
